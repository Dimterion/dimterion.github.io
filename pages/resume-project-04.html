      <p>
        I took some time to read through the new version of the React
        Documentation and decided to apply some of the examples from it to my
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't focus on the design and was mostly interested in building a
        site out of the code shown in the official React Docs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The site is made from multiple components, each related to a specific
          React functionality (it's mentioned throughout the pages there as
          well)
        </li>
        <li>
          I've also added a separate page with a table that stores most of the
          projects I've worked on so far. It can be seen
          <a
            href="https://portfolio-site-dimterion.vercel.app/projects"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            style="font-size: 1em"
            >here</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          I use this site like a sandbox to play around with some of the
          technologies I learn in case I need to see their practical
          implementation
        </li>
